# FEATURES

made even if you are offline. But it is necessary to be connected to
the internet when logging in to your account for the first time.

### B. QUICKBOOKS SYNCHRONIZATION

your accounts.

### C. SALES ANALYTICS

your daily sales and generates sales reports and analytics.

### D. SHIFT MANAGEMENT
- KaHero POS lets you manage your shifts between your
employees and track each of their shift hours and sales
transactions.

- KaHero POS is registered to the Bureau of Internal
Revenues. BIR accreditation is an essential regulation. KaHero
POS will assist you with that.
